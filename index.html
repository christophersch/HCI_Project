            <h4>A deadline-oriented task-tracking application</h4>
        </i></center>

        <br>
        <p>
            If you're here from DKE, you know what to do :)
        </p>
        <p>
            If not: This is part of a project where a user interface had to be developed and subsequently tested by users. The user testing phase serves to perform statistical analysis on the interface. Your time here is greatly appreciated!
        </p>
        <p>
            A brief description of the interface's purpose & idea can be found at the bottom of the page, but reading it is not necessary.
        </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            In the Prototypes section below are 2 links, both leading to different versions of the same prototype. In each of these, please do the following:

            <li>Add a new task (new card)</li>
            <li>Delete that task (remove card)</li>

            <br>
            Once you have followed these two instructions in both prototypes, fill in the questionnaire found further ahead.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Prototypes</h2>

            <p>
                <b>Please keep this page open while using the prototypes!</b>
            </p>
        <br>
        <script>
            // randomly give the user one of the prototypes first
            let x = Math.floor(Math.random()*2);
            let xT = 1-x;

            let words = ['JAZZ', 'MOON']

            x += 1;
            xT += 1;

            document.write('<li><a href=\'prototypes/' + x + '/preview.html\' target="_blank"> First prototype </a></li><br>');
            document.write('<li><a href=\'prototypes/' + xT + '/preview.html\' target="_blank"> Second prototype </a></li>');
            document.write('<br><p>Use the following <b>keyword</b> in the questionnaire: <strong>'+ words[x-1] +'</strong></p>')
        </script>
        <p>Your keyword will be used in the analysis to know which prototype you were shown first.</p>

        <h2>Questionnaire</h2>
        <p>Fill in the following questionnaire with your honest answers:</p>

        <br>
        <center>
            >>> <a href="https://forms.gle/vxEQURSEoYwbuZfz7">Questionnaire</a> <<<
        </center>
        <br>

        <p>
            You may leave the page now. Your answers will be used in a statistical analysis related to the interface's browsability. All personal information is anonymous.
        </p>

        <h2>What's the difference between both prototypes?</h2>
        <p>
            In one prototype, you can see your list of tasks (card deck) at all times while performing another task, i.e. when you create a new task, you can still see your existing cards in the background, and removing a task happens in the same view as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the other prototype, everything takes place on different screens. While creating or removing a task, you don't see the main deck anymore, as these states are new screens that take up the whole view.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a very subtle difference. The experiment mainly tests if users prefer viewing the whole system at once (every action occuring within the same view) while performing different actions, or if this does not really make a difference.
        </p>

        <h2>About Cardinal</h2>

        <p>
            Deadlines are omni-present in our busy day-to-day lives. From the student who rushes an assignment just before midnight, to the employee who needs to finish a project lest they wish to face the wrath of their manager.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <i>Cardinal</i> is a task-tracking application along the likes of Wunderlist and Trello, but with a simple twist. Instead of letting the user assign only one date to a task, the user inputs two dates: One being the <b>external</b> deadline, for example the 'due by' date on an assignment decided by a professor, the other being an <b>internal</b> deadline, by when the user wishes to get a task done ahead of time. Internal deadlines have been found to help with getting work done (Ariely & Wertenbroch, 2002).
